## Overview of Graph:

The data above shows covid-19 cases per capita and the status of the school systems in the country.

Looking at trends in covid case numbers we can predict the point at which they will be low enough that schools can reopen.

## P Value: Greater than 0.05

Therefore there is not significant statistical evidence for the alternative hypothesis (that there is a correlation between covid cases per capita and whether or not a country closes its schools.

# How Quality of Education is Affected by Covid

## Overview of Graph:
The data above shows student responses to how much they think digital learning tools affect their academic performance.

We can see that the mean tends towards strongly agreeing that digital learning tools are a major factor in their academic performance.

## P Value: Greater than 0.05
Therefore there is not significant statistical evidence for the alternative hypothesis (that there is a correlation between hours spent online (before and during covid) and how important students think digital learning tools are for their academic performance.


# Predicting Mental health of students based on number of COVID cases per capita

## Graph Overview
The data above uses the number of COVID cases per capita and the percentage of individuals having symptoms of anxiety/depression

Looking at the graph above, we can predict how the number of covid cases per capita can affect the mental health of students

## P-value: Greater than 0.05
Therefore there is not significant statistical evidence for the alternative hypothesis (that there is a correlation between covid cases in each state per capita and whether or not a state showed indicators of poor mental health
